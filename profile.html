            <p>I was born in Istanbul on April 6, 2002. I finished primary, secondary and high school in Istanbul/Bağcılar. I received compulsory education for 1 year in pre-school, 4 years in primary school, 4 years in secondary school, 4 years in high school, 12 years in total.</p>
            <p>I was accepted to Necmettin Erbakan University's computer engineering department on September 30, 2021 and started. My school is in Konya. Thanks to school, I go to many conferences. I had the opportunity to listen to and meet important people in the software field at conferences.</p>
            <p>I have not had any work experience in the software field before, but I have attended many online and face-to-face courses. I work in my father's liquor and market shop every summer during school holidays. All responsibility belongs to me during my employment and I am responsible for a team of approximately 10 people. Since the market is very crowded in the summer, there are customers working in every sector and I contact them.</p>
            <p>In general, I love leadership, teamwork and taking responsibility. I can say that when the team and facilities are good, there is no job that I cannot handle. I go camping in my spare time. I like to try all sports, especially adrenaline sports. I like to meet friendly and warm people. </p>
